# EMBEDED SYSTEM / HỆ NHÚNG - STM32F429FzIT6 and Led 7-segs

## Overview
 
 Programming STM32F429FzIT6 to show decimal numbers on two __7-segs leds__, pluged on breadboard with 2 [2N2222 transistors](https://dientusangtaovn.com/transistor-2n2222/).

- The PING 7-seg Led on the left with __7 current limit resistances__, 220/330 Ohm standard circuit installation.\
  However, the BLUE 7-seg Led on the right with __1 current limit resitance__ at common cathode pin, simple and cheep but low quality.\
  __2 current limit resitances__, \
  3.3/4.7 kOhm for base poles of transistors\
